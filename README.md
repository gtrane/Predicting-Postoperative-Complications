The goal of this project was to determine the best model to classify a dataset. My team chose to investigate the occurrence of postoperative complications following a general surgery. Our data was originally collected by Sessler et al. in their study titled “Operation Timing and 30-Day Mortality After Elective General Surgery”. Our dataset consists of a single CSV file that includes the records of 14,635 patients who underwent elective general surgery. Specifically, the dataset has information on the patient’s age, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, several surgical indices, and the surgical timing predictors. The full list of 25 features are detailed in the Surgery Timing Data Dictionary file. 

Orange was used as our software to create models. We used six classification models (neural network, logistic regression with regularization, k-nearest neighbors, classification tree, random forest, gradient boosted ensemble) with 10-fold cross validation on training and validation (80% of the dataset), before determining to move forward with the Random Forest on our testing set (20% of dataset). 

classificationforestProject.ows is the file used for Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. We also investigated logloss values using a feature constructor. We found the gradient boosting model had unreliable predictions with high logloss values in the older population (75+). This was not the case in Random Forest, so this model had more reliable predictions, a high AUC at 92%, and at our determined threshold, a recall of 90%.

The Data Science Project Write-Up and the powerpoint detail my team's findings, with our Powerpoint geared toward a managerial audience. We determined a Random Forest model, with a high weight on recall, as our best model. Using this model, a hospital can identify a vulnerable patient population that is at risk of developing a complication following surgery. Implimenations of our model include increased monitoring, follow-up appointments, medication management, and an emphasis on proper patient and caregiver education following surgery.
